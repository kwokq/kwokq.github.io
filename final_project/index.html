<h2 align="center">Suggestions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Suggestion 1: Use the correct HTML element for the content</li>
      <p>The title of each category is h5 size. However, under each category, the item is h2 size, which violates the intention of header: "to create a hierarchy of headline importance." and
      my suggestion to this is that the title of each category should be in h2 size and the items should be in h5 size.</p>

      <li>Suggestion 2: Avoid images and iconography in pseudo-elements</li>
      <p>In the footer section, the website use many icons link. However, these icons cannot be added with description, which makes it impossible for users who use screen readers to view the website properly. Thus, those icons should
      be replaced by image so that descriptive words could be included for the links.</p>

      <li>Suggestion 3: Links should be visually identifiable and have clear :focus and :active states</li>
      <p>The icon links do not have clear :focus and :active states, which makes it difficult for users who use screen readers to find out that those icons are actually links. However, if :active and :focus could be set,
      those screen reader users could hardly miss any links.</p>
